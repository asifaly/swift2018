<h2>MT&nbsp;305 Usage Rules</h2>



<ul>
<li>
<p>If the underlying contract is amended/cancelled on a bilateral basis, this should be agreed upon by a bilateral exchange of confirmations with either code AMEND or CANCEL, respectively.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>Changes to the amount, and/or strike price, and/or premium price, and/or exercise date and/or settlement information require another confirmation.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>Some users have bilaterally agreed to confirm Non Deliverable Options in an MT 305 instead of an MT 306. This usage is based on bilateral agreements.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>When there is optional early termination that applies to the confirmation of the transactions, the MT 306 should be used.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>This message should not be used for commodities. For confirmations of commodities options the MT 601 should be used.
</p></li>

</ul>



<h3>Industry requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li>
<p>If field 77H specifies ISDA as the type of master agreement, the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions (the FX definitions, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Emerging Markets Traders Association and The Foreign Exchange Committee) as amended and supplemented from time to time are incorporated into this confirmation unless field 14C states another version of the above mentioned FX definitions.

</p>
<p><span class="INSERTED">If Party A and Party B have not entered into any ISDA Master Agreement or other master agreement, Party A and Party B agree to use all reasonable efforts to promptly negotiate, execute, and deliver an agreement in the form of a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Form"), with such modifications as Party A and Party B will in good faith agree. Upon the execution by Party A and Party B of such an agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and be subject to that agreement.

Upon the execution by Party A and Party B of such an agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and be subject to that agreement. All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation except as expressly modified below. Until Party A and Party B execute and deliver that agreement, this Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each a "Confirmation") confirming transactions (each a "Transaction") entered into between Party A and Party B (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation) shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if Party and Party B had executed that agreement in such form (but without any Schedule thereto except for the election of English Law as the governing law, EUR as Termination Currency and Automatic Early Termination not applicable to Party A and Party B, provided, however, that where the Event of Default specified in Sections 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) of the ISDA Form or, to the extent analogous thereto, Section 5(a)(vii)(8) of the ISDA Form is governed by a system of law which does not permit termination to take place after the occurrence of the relevant Event of Default, then the Automatic Early Termination provision of Section 6(a) of the ISDA Form shall apply to the Defaulting Party) on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of that agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of this Transaction.</span>
